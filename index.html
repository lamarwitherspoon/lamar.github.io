	<h1>Calculating your 20118 -2019 Cost of Attendance</h1>
</div>

<h3>At Wilmington University</h3>

<div class="par1">
	
<p>
	The total amout of federal student aid for which you qualify at Wilmigton University for the entire academic year is determined by your Budget or "Cost of Attendance". Therefore, changes in your enrollment will direcly impact your financial aid.
</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>
		Your intial "Cost of Attendance" (COA) assigned for the year is based on the anticipated attendance you told us when the WU App for Financial Aid online. However, your COA must be recalculated if you do not attend for a full 4 months in each semester - thus your total aid <b>MAY BE REDUCED </b> to prevent or fix an over - award. An over-award over-award occurs when your total aid exceeds your COA for the year.
